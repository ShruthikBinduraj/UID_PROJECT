ðŸ“¦ E-Commerce Website Project Description Our e-commerce website is a fully functional online shopping platform designed to provide users with a seamless and engaging shopping experience. The site allows users to browse products, view detailed information, add items to the cart, and proceed to checkout. It features a clean, responsive design compatible across all devices.

This project was collaboratively developed by a dedicated team of four members, each contributing their unique skills to bring the website to life:

Adhithyan S â€“ Responsible for designing and drawing the overall structure and layout of the website, including the navigation flow and page hierarchy. His planning ensured a user-friendly and intuitive interface. He also contributed to developing the HTML structure of the website.

Shruthik Binduraj â€“ Handled the JavaScript components of the site, implementing functionalities such as  form validations, cart operations, and interactivity.

Abhinav P Madhu â€“ Developed the HTML structure of the web pages, creating the skeleton of the site including headers, product sections, forms, and navigation elements.

Naveen Raj R â€“ Took charge of CSS styling, making the website visually appealing and responsive. He ensured consistent design, color schemes, layout alignment, and responsiveness across devices.

This collaborative effort showcases each memberâ€™s contribution toward building a user-centered and aesthetically pleasing e-commerce platform.
