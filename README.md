ðŸ“¦ E-Commerce Website Project Description Our e-commerce website is a fully functional online shopping platform designed to provide users with a seamless and engaging shopping experience. The site allows users to browse products, view detailed information, add items to the cart, and proceed to checkout. It features a clean, responsive design compatible across all devices.

This project was collaboratively developed by a dedicated team of four members, each contributing their unique skills to bring the website to life:

Adhithyan S â€“ Responsible for designing and drawing the overall structure and layout of the website, including the navigation flow and page hierarchy. His planning ensured a user-friendly and intuitive interface. He also developed the Builder Info page, handling its HTML, CSS, and JavaScript components.

Shruthik Binduraj â€“ Implemented the Home page JavaScript functionalities, including interactive features, and cart operations, enhancing the dynamic behavior of the site.

Abhinav P Madhu â€“ Created the Login page, developing its complete HTML, CSS, and JavaScript structure to ensure secure and user-friendly access.

Naveen Raj R â€“ Developed the Home page layout using HTML and CSS. He was also responsible for the visual styling of the website, ensuring responsiveness, consistent design, and clean layout across all devices.

This collaborative effort showcases each memberâ€™s contribution toward building a user-centered and aesthetically pleasing e-commerce platform.
